Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the magenta block is clear, the black block is clear, the cyan block is clear, the green block is clear, the violet block is clear, the gold block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table, the magenta block is on the table, the black block is on the table, the cyan block is on the table, the green block is on the table, the violet block is on the table and the gold block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the cyan block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the magenta block is on top of the green block, the black block is on top of the yellow block, the cyan block is on top of the gold block, the green block is on top of the black block and the violet block is on top of the magenta block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the cyan block\nstack the cyan block on top of the gold block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the cyan block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the blue block\npick up the black block\nstack the black block on top of the yellow block\npick up the green block\nstack the green block on top of the black block\npick up the magenta block\nstack the magenta block on top of the green block\npick up the violet block\nstack the violet block on top of the magenta block\n[PLAN END]\n\nDuring execution, an unexpected event has occurred.\nAfter executing the action \"pick up the cyan block\" at step 1 in the plan, the following facts unexpectedly became true: the cyan block is clear, the hand is empty and the cyan block is on top of the black block\nThe following facts became unexpectedly false: the black block is clear and the hand is currently holding cyan block\nAfter re-planning from the new state, the plan is as follows:\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the black block is clear, the cyan block is clear, the green block is clear, the violet block is clear, the silver block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table, the black block is on the table, the cyan block is on the table, the green block is on the table, the violet block is on the table and the silver block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the silver block, the black block is on top of the red block, the cyan block is on top of the green block, the violet block is on top of the black block and the silver block is on top of the cyan block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the cyan block\nstack the cyan block on top of the green block\npick up the silver block\nstack the silver block on top of the cyan block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the silver block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the blue block\npick up the black block\nstack the black block on top of the red block\npick up the violet block\nstack the violet block on top of the black block\n[PLAN END]\n\nDuring execution, an unexpected event has occurred.\nAfter executing the action \"pick up the cyan block\" at step 1 in the plan, the following facts unexpectedly became true: the cyan block is clear, the hand is empty and the cyan block is on top of the green block\nThe following facts became unexpectedly false: the green block is clear and the hand is currently holding cyan block\nAfter re-planning from the new state, the plan is as follows:\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the magenta block is clear, the black block is clear, the cyan block is clear, the green block is clear, the violet block is clear, the silver block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on the table, the white block is on the table, the magenta block is on the table, the black block is on the table, the cyan block is on the table, the green block is on the table, the violet block is on the table and the silver block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the white block, the white block is on top of the green block, the magenta block is on top of the cyan block, the black block is on top of the violet block, the cyan block is on top of the silver block, the green block is on top of the magenta block and the silver block is on top of the black block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the black block\nstack the black block on top of the violet block\npick up the silver block\nstack the silver block on top of the black block\npick up the cyan block\nstack the cyan block on top of the silver block\npick up the magenta block\nstack the magenta block on top of the cyan block\npick up the green block\nstack the green block on top of the magenta block\npick up the white block\nstack the white block on top of the green block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the white block\n[PLAN END]\n\nDuring execution, an unexpected event has occurred.\nAfter executing the action \"pick up the black block\" at step 1 in the plan, the following facts unexpectedly became true: the black block is clear, the hand is empty and the black block is on top of the cyan block\nThe following facts became unexpectedly false: the cyan block is clear and the hand is currently holding black block\nAfter re-planning from the new state, the plan is as follows:\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the magenta block is clear, the black block is clear, the cyan block is clear, the green block is clear, the violet block is clear, the silver block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on the table, the white block is on the table, the magenta block is on the table, the black block is on the table, the cyan block is on the table, the green block is on the table, the violet block is on the table and the silver block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the cyan block, the white block is on top of the magenta block, the magenta block is on top of the green block, the cyan block is on top of the silver block, the green block is on top of the violet block, the violet block is on top of the yellow block and the silver block is on top of the black block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the silver block\nstack the silver block on top of the black block\npick up the cyan block\nstack the cyan block on top of the silver block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the cyan block\npick up the violet block\nstack the violet block on top of the yellow block\npick up the green block\nstack the green block on top of the violet block\npick up the magenta block\nstack the magenta block on top of the green block\npick up the white block\nstack the white block on top of the magenta block\n[PLAN END]\n\nDuring execution, an unexpected event has occurred.\nAfter executing the action \"pick up the silver block\" at step 1 in the plan, the following facts unexpectedly became true: the silver block is clear, the hand is empty and the silver block is on top of the black block\nThe following facts became unexpectedly false: the black block is clear and the hand is currently holding silver block\nAfter re-planning from the new state, the plan is as follows:\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the magenta block is clear, the black block is clear, the violet block is clear, the silver block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on the table, the magenta block is on the table, the black block is on the table, the violet block is on the table and the silver block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the magenta block, the black block is on top of the silver block, the violet block is on top of the orange block and the silver block is on top of the violet block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the magenta block\npick up the violet block\nstack the violet block on top of the orange block\npick up the silver block\nstack the silver block on top of the violet block\npick up the black block\nstack the black block on top of the silver block\n[PLAN END]\n\nDuring execution, an unexpected event has occurred.\nAfter executing the action \"pick up the silver block\" at step 5 in the plan, the following facts unexpectedly became true: the silver block is clear, the hand is empty and the silver block is on top of the black block\nThe following facts became unexpectedly false: the black block is clear and the hand is currently holding silver block\nAfter re-planning from the new state, the plan is as follows:\n[PLAN]",
